## Usage

### Quick start

tl;dr -> develop with `npm run tdd` and `npm run tdd:int`, use `npm run dev` to run local environment.

### User image uploads

To have image uploads working locally you'll need a valid aws key/secret pair. Run it like so:

```bash
IMAGE_UPLOAD_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ACCESSKEYHERE IMAGE_UPLOAD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRETKEYHERE npm run dev
```

### Email notifications

To have email notification working locally you'll need a valid aws key/secret pair. Run it like so:

```bash
SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ACCESSKEYHERE SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRETKEYHERE npm run dev
```

### Database migrations

Ensure any database migration is backwards compatible with a previous version of the api. This will keep deployments simple and clean.

```bash
ENV={ENV} npm run migrate
```

#### Migration test runs

##### Prepare step

Starts a database container and exposes it to 127.0.0.1:3306

```bash
npm run mtr-prepare
```

##### Run step

Runs the migration against the test database. Make sure to have your migrations written in `src/migration/scripts`, with the db models in their origin (pre-migrated) state in `src/lib/models`.

```bash
npm run mtr
```

##### Revert step

Run after running test migration to roll back changes.

```bash
npm run mtr-revert
```

## Deployments

Deployments to production are triggered by tagged commits, tag with `npm version major|minor|patch`. Deployments to test are done adhoc and are _almost_ manual.
